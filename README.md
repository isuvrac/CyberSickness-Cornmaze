# CyberSickness-Cornmaze
A corn maze designed to be a testbed for cybersickness experiments.

Check out this video demonstration: https://youtu.be/GI5c5vbf7Fk

# Description

This is the first iteration of a Corn maze that includes navigation of a corn maze with obstacles with an on rails navigation system that moves the player through the maze

# How To?

All the scene controls currently implemented can be controlled from the GameSettings script

The project is currently set up to run with Oculus and has been tested on the Oculus Quest with the Oculus Link

# Coming Soon

The next version(s) of the maze hope to include:

-Player Controlled Movement
-User Interface to decide number of run throughs of the maze (DONE)
-Sickness measurements
-Data collection and data writing to project files
-SteamVR integration (DONE)
and More!
